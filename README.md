# CigarFinder

## An application to look up cigar information
Problem: Many customers rely on color to identify the strength of a cigar when a complete profile of the wrapper, binder, and filler would give the best indication of strength and quality, helping the customer make better purchasing decisions.

Solution: A simple application to query a database for information on a specific cigar and displays the wrapper, binder, filler, country of origin, strength and flavor profiles, etc.
